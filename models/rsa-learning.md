## Learning with RSA

Our general goal is to determine whether RSA provides a good inductive bias for learning. There are several dimensions along which RSA may improve learning:

1. Within-training-set learning. RSA may reduce the number of training examples necessary to learn correct interpretations for utterances in the training data.
2. Generalization across contexts.
3. Generalization across observation types.
